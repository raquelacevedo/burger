## Description

Burger is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Burger follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

## Features

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


* Burger will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not minus the calories.
